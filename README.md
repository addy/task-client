# React Template
This repository is a Github Template project!

### Prerequisites
1. Node.JS
2. Yarn
3. VS Code (Obviously optional)

### Installing
1. ```yarn install```

### Running dev build
1. ```yarn start```

### Building static assets for production
2. ```yarn build```

## Notes
1. If you're creating an application, you will probably have an API. So, I've taken the liberty of including an API proxy into the Webpack dev config @ port 5000. For production, I recommend using a reverse proxy through Nginx.
2. This template does not tie you to any CSS frameworks. If you choose to use one, I recommend Tailwind.
3. This template does not tie you to any testing frameworks. I recommend Jest.
